I am a first year Epidemiology PhD student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My background is in biostatistics, both as a SAS programmer in clinical trials and as a statistician in observational studies using claims and EH data. 

My husband is finishing up his PhD this semester, and as I started my program one of his pieces of advice was to start a blog early to summarize papers I read that I can reference back to. So this is that.
